## Features/requirements and how to implement them




### Default toggles

Define toggles to be active by default for e.g. devices needing constant electricity

#### What you need:

* Add the id of the toggle's `data-target` to the `defaultTogglesOn` array

#### Example:

```js
defaultTogglesOn = [
    "#kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-two",
    "#kitchen-stove-control-oven-one"
];
```




### Exclude toggles from global reset

Define toggles not to be reset by the global reset button, e.g. devices needing constant electricity

#### What you need:

* Add the id of the toggle's `data-target` to the `globalControlResetExclude` array

#### Example:

```js
globalControlResetExclude = [
    "#kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-two"
];
```




### Global station

Shows if at least one toggle is active in the specified section

#### What you need:

* On all new `toggle-local-control` elements make sure to follow the markup and add a correct `data-group`.
	* The `data-group` needs to be the same in the entire section!
* That's it, the script will take care of everything else.


#### Example:

```html
<div
class="toggle toggle-light toggle-local-control kitchen-stove-control"
id="kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-one"
data-target="#kitchen-stove-hotplate-one"
data-group="station-group-kitchen"></div>
```




### Emergency toggle


#### What you need:

* wrapping class: `[section]-emergency-content`
* wrapping id for name/heading: `[section]-emergency-name`
* `toggle` element with
	* class: additional `toggle-local-emergency` 
	* id: `[section]-emergency` 
	* data-name: referring to id from name/heading (2.)
	* data-target: referring to id from content (`[section]-content`) 


#### Example:

```html
<div class="kitchen-emergency-content">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-7">
            <div id="kitchen-emergency-name">
                Not-Taster KÃ¼che
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-5">
            <div class="toggle toggle-light toggle-local-emergency"
                 id="kitchen-emergency" data-name="#kitchen-emergency-name"
                 data-target="#kitchen-content"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```


#### What it also does:

* Opens a modal (popup with a warning message)
* Writes the warning message into a log area
* Makes the area blink after closing the modal
* After disabling the toggle again (aka problem fixed) it will
	* Remove the message from the modal (would show on next activation of maybe a different toggle if not deactivated/fixed before)
	* Add a success message to the log
	* Stop blinking (finally)
