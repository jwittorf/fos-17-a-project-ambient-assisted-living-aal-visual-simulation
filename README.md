# Features/requirements and how to implement them

## Default toggles
Define toggles to be active by default for e.g. devices needing constant electricity

#### What you need:
* Add the id of the toggle's `data-target` to the `defaultTogglesOn` array

#### Example:
```js
defaultTogglesOn = [
    "#kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-two",
    "#kitchen-stove-control-oven-one"
];
```

---------------------------------------


### Exclude toggles from global reset
Define toggles not to be reset by the global reset button, e.g. devices needing constant electricity

#### What you need:
* Add the id of the toggle's `data-target` to the `globalControlResetExclude` array

#### Example:
```js
globalControlResetExclude = [
    "#kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-two"
];
```

---------------------------------------


## Global station
Shows if at least one toggle is active in the specified section

#### What you need:
* On all new `toggle-local-control` elements make sure to follow the markup and add a correct `data-group`.
	* The `data-group` needs to be the same in the entire section!
* That's it, the script will take care of everything else.

#### Example:
```html
<div
class="toggle toggle-light toggle-local-control kitchen-stove-control"
id="kitchen-stove-control-hotplate-one"
data-target="#kitchen-stove-hotplate-one"
data-group="station-group-kitchen"></div>
```

---------------------------------------


## Emergency toggle
* In every section should be an emergency toggle.
* Activating it opens a modal (popup) with a warning message.
* After closing the modal
	* The area starts to blink
	* An entry is added to the log area
* If a different emergency toggle is triggered, the message from the toggle before will still show up in the modal!
* To remove the blinking and the "old" messages from the modal, just disable to activated toggle.
	* There will also be a new entry in the log, claiming the emergency has been resolved.
* 

#### What you need:
* wrapping class: `[section]-emergency-content`
* wrapping id for name/heading: `[section]-emergency-name`
* `toggle` element with
	* class: additional `toggle-local-emergency` 
	* id: `[section]-emergency` 
	* data-name: referring to id from name/heading (2.)
	* data-target: referring to id from content (`[section]-content`) 

#### Example:
```html
<div class="kitchen-emergency-content">
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-xs-7">
            <div id="kitchen-emergency-name">
                Not-Taster KÃ¼che
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-5">
            <div class="toggle toggle-light toggle-local-emergency"
                 id="kitchen-emergency" data-name="#kitchen-emergency-name"
                 data-target="#kitchen-content"></div>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

## Global timer

Simulates a morning (wake-up) and a night (sleep).
During night until morning all possible local control toggles (devices, aka globalTimerToggles) will be set to disabled an inactive.
This refers to all local control toggles, that are NOT excluded from the global reset. What is excluded from global reset will not be disabled and set inactive.

#### How it works
* On activation all possible local control toggles (devices, aka globalTimerToggles) will be set inactive and disabled (simulate the night).
* After the start time, all globalTimerToggles will be enabled again, so you can set them active (simulate the day).
* The stop time determines after what time in seconds AFTER THE START TIME the globalTimerToggles will again be set inactive and disabled (simulate the night).
* After going back to night mode, the checkbox for enabling the timer will be enabled again.
	* Uncheck it to enable the globalTimerToggles again, so you can set them active or inactive for further simulation.

#### Use it like this
* Set a start time in seconds (time from initial night to morning, since we start at night)
* Set a stop time in seconds (time from set morning to night, aka duration of the day)
	* Will be added on top of the start time,
	so if you have 5 seconds start and 10 seconds stop,
	the action will happen 10 seconds after enabling the globalTimerToggles
